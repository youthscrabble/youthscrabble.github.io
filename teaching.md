I've been a Teaching Assistant for a couple of courses during my stay so far at IIT Bombay.
* **ME 119: Engineering Graphics and Drawing**: This is for the Spring Term 2020. My role includes reviewing problem sets to be supplied to students, solving and subsequently grading them, all on a weekly basis. You can find problem sets, solutions and marking guidelines [here](bit.ly/ME-119).
* **MA 108: Ordinary Differential Equations**: This was for the Summer Term 2019. This position entailed mentoring and conducting tutorial sessions for a batch of 20 academically underperforming students over three weeks and grading weekly quizzes and an end-semester exam. Prof G. K. Srinivasan had provided some excellent notes (replete with historical commentary) on the subject and you can find them [here](Notes.pdf). The tutorial sheets we used can be found [here](Tutorial Sheets.pdf).
