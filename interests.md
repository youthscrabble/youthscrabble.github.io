I am currently working on designing a 'Fluid Flow Calibration System' at the THTF Lab, IIT Bombay.

Here are a few more interesting things I have done over the course of my stay at IIT Bombay.
- **Teaching Assistant** for the course **MA 108: Ordinary Differential Equations** for the Summer Term 2019
- Worked as a trainee in the Electrical Subdivision for [**IIT Bombay Racing**](https://www.iitbracing.org) - the institute's award-winning Formula Student Team
