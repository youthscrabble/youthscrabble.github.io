- I am currently working on designing a **Fluid Flow Calibration System** at the THTF Lab, IIT Bombay.
- I am one of two students nominated by IIT Bombay to attend [Summer University 2020](https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/Incoming-students/Summer-University) at the Technical University of Denmark.
- Being the massive football fan that I am, I'm also working on a machine learning powered model to predict the Premier League standings. I'll soon be posting stuff that I do related to this project.
- I was also a part of [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/) - the institute's award-winning Formula Student Team where I studied three modules, namely *High Voltage Safety*, *System Integration* and *Controller Area Network*.
