title: About Me
---

Hi! I'm Aditya Iyengar and this is my personal webpage. I would like to maintain this webpage for the compilation of my academic work.

I am a second year undergraduate student at **IIT Bombay**. My major is in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in).
I'm currently pursuing a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in).
My interests broadly lie in the areas of **Fluid Dynamics**, **Stochastic Models** and **Mechatronics**.

I play **Scrabble** at the international level. I've represented India at multiple World Championships, both open and age-group. You can find my all-time Scrabble tournament record [here](https://wespa.org/aardvark/cgi-bin/statsbootstrap.cgi?name1=Aditya%20Iyengar).

I like **travelling** a lot and I have visited 13 countries till date. I also enjoy cycling and listening to music, particularly indie and psychedelic.
I'm also an avid reader and you can, more often than not, find me immersed in a novel. It's hard to pick out a favourite, but I'm a decent Agatha Christie fan.

You can view my _curriculum vitae_ [here](Resume 2pg tech.pdf).
